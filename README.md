# VirtualDJ-LocalJSONTool

Tool written in Python to help you using [VirtualDJ-LocalJSON-Win64](https://github.com/DJCEL/VirtualDJ-LocalJSON-Win64)

It enables to read/modify the LocalJSON.json file used by the plugin LocalJSON.dll

You need to replace this string with your actual Windows username:
```python
username = "YourWindowsUsername"
```


The 'LocalJSONTool.sln' and 'LocalJSONTool.pyproj' files are created by Visual Studio 2022 but you can use your own Python IDE (Spyder, ...).
